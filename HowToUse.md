### Log onto https://codefundo2019.tk. Then follow these steps:
- **Step 1**: On entering voting camp, the EVM will have our portal open, where the voter will have to enter the pass-phrase given to him in the pre-voting phase<br /> ![Page 1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29022394/63441238-b8e4b400-c44e-11e9-8bcd-99385d0c05df.png)<br />
- **Step 2**: On supplying his pass-phrase, the portal will show a list of candidates from the constituency the voter is in. He will be able to choose one candidate to vote for.<br/> ![Page 2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29022394/63441239-b97d4a80-c44e-11e9-9154-d200c9a06363.png)<br />
- **Step 3**: A confirmation page will pop up with the name and face of the candidate. The user will confirm his choice or be able to go back.<br/>![Page 3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29022394/63441240-b97d4a80-c44e-11e9-9dc3-08aa28e2a479.png)<br/>
- **Step 4**: A QR code will be presented to the voter. The voter can then use the camera on his phone to confirm whether that vote is truly his.<br/> ![Page 4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29022394/63441241-ba15e100-c44e-11e9-80a9-ede037b2ff4b.png)<br/>This ensures that the EVM has not been tampered with. Once that is confirmed, a confirmatory message is shown<br/>![Page 5](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29022394/63441242-ba15e100-c44e-11e9-9304-b36d118cd6a5.png)
